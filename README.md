# High-Speed Input Macro Tool for Video Games

This tool allows you to automate keyboard and mouse inputs with **zero delay** to perform high-speed actions in video games. It simulates key presses and mouse clicks at **extremely high speeds**, allowing for precise control in games that require rapid input, such as **spamming buttons**, **executing combos**, or **repetitive tasks**.

**Warning:** although undetectable This tool should only be used in **single-player** games or **within the bounds of game rules**. The use of automation tools in online or competitive multiplayer games may violate the terms of service and lead to penalties such as account bans.

## üåê How It Works

The tool utilizes **pyautogui** to simulate keyboard and mouse inputs at an extremely high speed. The goal is to perform repetitive tasks (e.g., pressing a key 100 times per second) with **zero delay**. The automation script can be customized to execute specific game actions like combos or repetitive key spamming.

### Key Features:
1. **Zero-delay Input Simulation**: The macro simulates pressing keys or mouse clicks without noticeable delay, providing maximum speed for tasks that require repetitive actions.
2. **Custom Profiles**: You can configure the tool for **different games** with specific inputs, such as setting up macros for **farming**, **combat rotations**, or **button spamming**.
3. **Speed Control**: Adjust the speed of key presses to make it faster or slower depending on the needs of the game you are automating.
